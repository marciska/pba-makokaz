## Setting Up

Please look at the following document for environment setup, creating branch, and making pull request.

[How to Submit the Assignment](../doc/submit.md)

- make sure you synchronised the `main` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task1` from `main` branch. 
- make sure you are currently in the `task1` branch (use `git branch -a` command).
  

Additionally, you need the library [DelFEM2](https://github.com/nobuyuki83/delfem2) in `pba-<username>/3rd_party` 

```bash
$ cd pba-<username> # go to the top of local repository
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/delfem2
```

(DelFEM2 is a collection of useful C++ codes written by the instructor).

## Problem 2

Modify `main.cpp` to collide points with the circular obstacle in the middle (see around 92th line of the code). Just 4 or 5 lines of codes need to be modified. We assume that the **coefficient of restitution** is one.
